# Introduction
Contributing to this project might be somewhat tricky, the main thing that should be noticed and remembered is that we don't intend to bring whole codebase to modern C++ standard. Parts of code that need changing, or newly added code, should be written in modern standard, the rest should be left "as is". This project uses Stroustrup indentation style, and it should be used every time changes are made.

# Helping
Before you start helping, you should join our discord server, so we can keep in contact with you, and create a issue. Issues should be clear and descriptive, use either "bug" or enchancement" label, depending if you would like to report error or request a feature. After you get a green light to get into action, simply fork the repository and submit a pull request of your branch so we can follow your progress and merge it once it's complete. 

# Commits
If your are working on something small, then you shouldn't be worried about the amount of commits, but if you work on something larger, follow the philosophy of atomic commits. If your commit is related to particular issue, include it's number in the commit body like: `my commit(#312)`
